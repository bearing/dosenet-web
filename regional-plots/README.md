### This is an updated version of the bar graph (first plot) on [the website](https://radwatch.berkeley.edu/partner-locations/).

### Features
* dropdown menu that allows users to change units (CPM; Î¼Sv/hr)
* color-coding by region (America; Asia; Europe)

#### Note: The `plot.py` file generates two html files: `cpm_plot.html` and `msv_plot.html`. These two files will be embedded as iframes within `plot.html`.
