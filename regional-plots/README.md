# Most recent average dose rates ordered by region

### This is an updated version of the bar graph (first plot) on [the website](https://radwatch.berkeley.edu/partner-locations/).

### Features
* dropdown menu that allows users to change units (CPM; Î¼Sv/hr and PM2.5/PM10; AQI2.5/AQI10)
* color-coding by region (America; Asia; Europe)
* hover over bars to see date ranges

Note: `plot.py` and `plot_aq.py` both generate files in the `generated/` directory.
* `plot.py` generates `cpm_plot.html` and `msv_plot.html`, which will be embedded as iframes within `plot.html`
* `plot_aq.py` generates the following:
	* `PM10_plot.html`
	* `PM25_plot.html`
	* `AQI10_plot.html`
	* `AQI25_plot.html`
